# RISC_V_SINGLE_CORE( NON_PIPELINED )

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V CPU based on the RV32I base integer instruction set architecture (ISA). This is a *non-pipelined*, single-cycle implementation, meaning each instruction completes execution within a single clock cycle.
